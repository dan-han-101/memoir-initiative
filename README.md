# memoir-initiative
Starting point for writing your memoirs.

# Background
I want to write something about my life that my kids could read later. So, I started this project.

# How to use this project?
I'm not sure yet.

To start, this repository will just have a compilation of questions and prompts that you could use to start writing.

Later, I envision some sort of workflow/application that facilitates writing and sharing and discovering of yours and others memiors. If that sort of thing sounds appealing to you, let me know.
